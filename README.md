Tool project: I write a lot of notes, dream diaries, and snapshots of my world tucked away in my Obsidian. In a world bombarded with information, I'm curious what it could look like to more mindfully surface one's own notes and diaries. Instead of scrolling through content designed to hook you, sitting with tokens from your past selves. Concretely, this can look like RAG on the backend, and a frontend that aims to allow for creative probing of a current thought, feeling, or desire.

Art project: How would you write down the timeline of your own life? Would it have many branches? Would you want to revert to a certain point? For much of the first year after I lost my dad, I found it difficult to talk about my life, and to think about it in time. Wise words from my grief counselor: you will get to be able to tell the story, and you will tell it in different ways — one day you might even feel content as you speak your story. I want to make an artifact of my life as a git repo. Commits, branches, updated beliefs, and open issues. A version-controlled life, where nothing is deleted, only committed to.

Both of these stem from the hope that AI could help us understand ourselves better. To have the autonomy over our own evolution, and to tell our own stories.

### MVP
- first version: you journal about your life explicitly, and it get turned into a git repo with the date information you give it 
    - api call on the backend
    - automatic git generation and date rewrite 
    - visualization: use an available git branch visualizer 
    - develop some prompt around how the journaling should be processed
